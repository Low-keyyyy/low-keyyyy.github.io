Today the Lowkeyyyy's blog is born!🎉 It feels great to have my first website of my own in my life!🤩🤩

Here are some basic information and the purpose of this website below.⬇️

---

This website is built using the open-source al-folio template, based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on GitHub Pages. I choose al-folio for its clean, minimalist design—free of flashy effects or unnecessary flair—which aligns perfectly with my aesthetic preferences. I express heartfelt gratitude to all the contributors! [Click here to learn about al-folio.](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio)

The purpose of this site is to create a personal "home" on the internet, where I can simply record my learning, work and life. It also serves as a hub to organize my various online resources into a cohesive structure. Beyond that, I hope it allows more people to get to know who I am.

> All the wonders are just beginning.
