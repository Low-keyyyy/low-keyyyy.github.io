Since September 2023, I have been studying as an undergraduate student at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), Jiangsu, China, majoring in [Software Engineering](https://software.nju.edu.cn/). Enthralled by the elegance of code and algorithms, I harbor a profound interest in computer programming and software development, seeking to leverage computational power to transcend the limits of my abilities and realize an array of creative and captivating ideas. Though I may not be gifted in software engineering, like Winston Churchill, "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat."

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
