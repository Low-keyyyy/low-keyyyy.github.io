Since September 2023, I have been studying as an undergraduate student at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), Jiangsu, China, majoring in [Software Engineering](https://software.nju.edu.cn/). Enthralled by the elegance of code and algorithms, I harbor a profound interest in computer programming and software development, seeking to leverage computational power to transcend the limits of my abilities and realize an array of creative and captivating ideas. Though I may not be gifted in software engineering, like Winston Churchill, "I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat."

With two years' learning in the college, I have acquired a fundamental knowledge of computer science. At present, I am interested in fields such as machine learning, cybersecurity, distributed computing, secure multi-party computation, etc. Exploring some of these fields in depth is on the horizon.

In addition to my major, other subjects like History, Literature, and Economics attract me as well. Recently, I am dabbling in several economics courses to broaden my perspective.

If these topics fascinate you too, welcome to contact me for a enjoyable discussion! Contact information is below.

##### More to Say
As you can see, the title of my blog is "Lowkeyyyy", which is the online username I’ve consistently used across the internet for a long time. This name dates back to my junior high school days and is derived from the term "low-key." I adapted it to remind myself to never become complacent, to always stay humble, and to keep moving forward. At the time, "Low-key" was already taken on many social platforms, so I removed the hyphen and repeated the "y" at the end, resulting in today’s "Lowkeyyyy." However, it should be noted that not every "Lowkeyyyy" is necessarily me.

At the same time, the website’s icon is a cartoon picture of television. This is because the abbreviation of my name happens to be exactly the same as abbreviation for "television" in Chiniese, so many friends of mine use it as a nickname for me. Of course, I also find "television" to be quite cute personally.
